The Reina-Valera, first published in 1569 and nicknamed the Bible of the
Bear, was published in Basel, Switzerland. It was not the first complete
Bible published in Spanish; several others, most notably the Alfonsina, were
published in previous centuries. The facsimile reproduction of this historic
text was published by the Spanish Bible Society (1970 ISBN
84-8083-073-5). Its principal translator was Casiodoro de Reina, an
Independent Evangelical but a manuscript found at the Bodleian Library
gives further evidence of the fact that the Spanish Bible was a community
project. The 1569 version included the deuterocanonical books in the Old
Testament.
